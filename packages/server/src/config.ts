 * How many proxies in front of this app are trusted to have written
 * `X-Forwarded-For`, counted from the app outwards. It becomes Fastify's
 * `trustProxy` (see `index.ts`), and through it the source of `request.ip`.
 *
 * At 1, `request.ip` is the entry the nearest proxy appended, which is the
 * address that proxy actually saw. Anything a client writes into the header
 * sits further left and is ignored. `true`, which this was until it became a
 * count, trusts the whole chain and takes the left-most entry: whatever the
 * client cared to send.
 *
 * That matters because this address is what every rate limit in the app keys
 * on, the global one and the per-route ones (`docs/systems/api.md`, "Rate
 * limiting") and the hand-written limiter on `POST /federation/peer/accept`,
 * which is unauthenticated first contact. It is also what the request log
 * records as `remoteAddress`.
 *
 * **What an operator sets it to.** The number of proxies they actually run
 * in front of the app:
 *
 * - `1` (the default) for the bundled Caddy, an operator's own reverse
 *   proxy, or a tunnel daemon. Every deployment mode this repo ships is one
 *   hop.
 * - `2` for a CDN in front of their own proxy. Left at 1, the app sees the
 *   CDN's address and everyone behind it lands in one rate-limit bucket.
 * - `0` for nothing in front at all. That case is not cosmetic: at 1 a lone
 *   `X-Forwarded-For` entry cannot be told apart from a proxy's word, so a
 *   directly exposed instance left at 1 believes whatever a client sends. At
 *   0 the header is ignored and the socket address is used.
 *
 * Too low is a degradation (everyone behind the nearest proxy shares a
 * bucket); too high is a hole (the key goes back to the client). When in
 * doubt, too low.
 *
 * **It governs the address and nothing else.** The rest of the
 * `X-Forwarded-*` family is trusted or not, without following the count: at
 * any value of 1 or more, `request.protocol` and `request.hostname` come from
 * `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` (the last entry, whatever the
 * number), and at 0 they come from the socket and the `Host` header. Raising
 * the count to 2 for a CDN therefore changes which address is billed and
 * leaves protocol and host exactly where they were. No route in this server
 * reads either of those two, which is what keeps that from mattering; a route
 * that starts building a URL from the request host would make it matter.
 *
 * Both ways of getting it wrong refuse to boot rather than resolving to
 * something the operator did not choose: a value that is not a non-negative
 * integer, and a value above `MAX_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`. See
 * `docs/systems/web-security.md` section 9 and
 * `docs/systems/deployment.md`, "Server proxy-awareness".
